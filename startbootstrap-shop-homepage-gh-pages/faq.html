                                To ensure a smooth and enjoyable experience while trying on bridal dresses, we recommend wearing something comfortable and easy to change in and out of, such as a simple dress or a button-up top with leggings. This will make the fitting process quicker and more convenient.
                                <br><br>
                                For undergarments, we suggest bringing a <strong>white or nude bra and panties</strong>, as these will provide the best foundation for more dresses, ensuring a seamless and flattering fit.
                                If you plan on wearing <strong>shapewear or a specific corset</strong> under your gown, feel free to bring those along as well, as they can affect the fit and overall look of your dress.
                                <br><br>
                                Shoes are another important consideration. If you already have the heels or flats you plan to wear on your wedding day, bring them with you. If not, we recommend bringing a pair with a similar heel 
                                height so you can get an accurate sense of how your dress will fall and move.

                                Trying on wedding gowns is an exciting and special experience, but it can also be different from trying on regular dresses due to the intricate designs and delicate fabrics. 
                                Here's everything you need to know about getting changed into your bridal gown during your appointment.
                                <br><br>
                                <h6>What should I wear under the gown?</h6>
                                <br>
                                To maintain hygiene and ensure your comfort, we kindly ask that all brides <strong>wear panties at all times</strong> while trying on gowns. While some wedding dresses come with built-in support and do not require a bra, for sanitary reasons, you will also be required to <strong>wear a bra</strong> while trying on dresses. If you are unsure whether your gown should be worn with a bra on your wedding day, your consultant can guide you based on the gown’s design and fit.
                                <br><br>✔ Nude or seamless underwear is recommended to prevent visible lines under the gowns.
                                <br>✔ A strapless bra can be helpful for certain dress styles but is not always necessary.
                                <br>✔ Shapewear, garters, or stockings are completely optional—you are welcome to wear them if you plan to on your wedding day!
                                <br><br><h6>Should I wear shoes?</h6>
                                <br>
                                Shoes are <strong>not required</strong> while trying on gowns in the salon, but we highly recommend bringing a pair of <strong>heels with a similar height</strong> to your wedding shoes. This helpss you visualize how the gown will fall and allows us to make any necessary length adjustments during fittings. If you already have your wedding shoes, feel free to bring them along!
                                <br><br><h6>Getting into the gown</h6>
                                <br>
                                Wedding gowns are often made with <strong>heavy fabrics, intricate lace, long trains, and multiple layers</strong>, which can make them more challenging to put on than regular clothing. Many gowns also have delicate fastenings, corset backs, or dozens of buttons, which require assistance to secure properly.
                                <br><br>
                                If you are comfortable, your <strong>bridal consultant will be happy to assist you</strong> in getting into your gown. Our consultants are highly trained professionals, so there's no need to be embarrassed - they are there to ensure the gown fits you properly and to make the process as seamless as possible. Alternatively, if you prefer, one of your guests can help you change. We want you to feel completely at ease, so just let us know your preference!
                                <br><br><h6>How long does it take to get dressed?</h6>
                                <br>
                                Due to the complexity of wedding gowns, <strong>expect it to take a few minutes to get into each gown.</strong> Some gowns have multiple layers, intricate buttons, or corset lacing that require careful fastening. This is perfectly normal, and your consultant will guide you through the process to ensure everything looks perfect.
                                <br><br>
                                If you have any questions or special requests, don't hesitate to ask - we want to make your experience comfortable, enjoyable and truly magical! 💕👰✨

                                Try to schedule your first bridal appointment <strong>at least a year before your wedding</strong>. This gives you time to explore different styles, revist dresses if needed, and make a confident decision.
                                <br><br><h6>Final Fittings & Alterations</h6>
                                <br>Once your dress arrives, alterations typically require <strong>two to three fittings</strong> over a period of <strong>six to eight weeks</strong> Be sure to factor in this time so that your gown fits flawlessly by your big day.
                                <br><br>Starting early ensures a stress-free experience and gives you the best chance of securing your dream dress.

                                <strong>Bridal appointments are typically scheduled for two hours</strong>, giving you plenty of time to try on a variety of gowns, experiment with different silhouettes, and get a feel for what you love most. If you haven't found "the one" by the end of your appointment, don't worry - it's completely normal! Many brides need time to reflect on their options or try on additional dresses before making a final decision. If you need more time, we'll happily schedule a follow-up appointment as soon as possible, ensuring you work with the same bridal consultant for consistency.
